        <h3>Why to visit New York?</h3>
        <img src="new york.jpg" alt="new york image">
        <p>New York has to be one of the most famous cities in the world. Often referred to as the 'Big Apple', this vibrant city is known for its exclusive shops, flashy Broadway performances, and high-flying business tycoons, and it's a city that has long captivated people from all over the world.</p>
        <p>New York's growth in the early nineteenth century was driven by the rise of manufacturing in the city, which itself depended on New York's primacy as a port. New York's growth in the late nineteenth century owed at least as much to its role as the entryway for immigrants into the United States.</p>
